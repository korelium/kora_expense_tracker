🎯 KORA EXPENSE TRACKER - FLUTTER APP DEVELOPMENT CONTINUATION
📱 Current App Status:

I'm building a professional expense tracker app called "Kora Expense Tracker" with Flutter. We've successfully refactored from 2500+ line monster files to clean, maintainable architecture with proper file organization.


🏗️ Current Architecture:
lib/
├── database/          # Database helper, tables
├── models/           # Account, Transaction, Category, Enums  
├── screens/          # Main app screens (~300 lines each)
├── widgets/
│   ├── account/      # Account widgets
│   ├── credit_card/  # Credit card components
│   └── forms/        # Form widgets
├── utils/
│   └── formatters/   # Credit card formatters, date utils
└── services/         # Business logic services
✅ Features Successfully Implemented:

    Account Management: Bank accounts, credit cards, digital wallets

    Credit Card Features:

        Utilization tracking with CIBIL-focused 30% healthy limits

        Bill cycle display ("Bill: 15th - Due: 5th")

        Bill countdown ("Bill in 8 days")

        Health indicators (HEALTHY/MODERATE/HIGH)

    Transaction Management: Income/expense tracking

    Professional UI: Clean cards, gradients, proper spacing

    Indian Market Focus: HDFC, ICICI, SBI banks integration

🎯 Next Features to Build:

    Budget Management - Monthly/category budgets

    Expense Analytics - Charts, spending patterns

    Export Features - CSV/PDF reports

    Recurring Transactions - Auto-add monthly bills

    Bill Reminders - Notifications for due dates

    Category Insights - Top spending categories

    Monthly Reports - Spending summaries

💼 WORKING STYLE I WANT:
🔧 Development Approach:

    One feature at a time → Implement → Test → ✅ Confirm working → Next

    Systematic workflow: No rushing, proper testing after each change

    Clean code: Minimal comments, only for important features like // FEATURE: Bill countdown

📝 Code Instructions Format:

Always provide:

    📁 File: exact/path/filename.dart

    📍 Line ~XXX: Look for specific method/code block

    🔍 Search for: "exact code snippet to find"

    ❌ Current Code: Show what to replace

    ✅ Updated Code: Show new code with clear boundaries

🎓 Mentoring Style:

    Act like a senior developer mentor - professional, encouraging, experienced

    Explain WHY decisions matter for production apps

    Focus on best practices - architecture, testing, maintainability

    Balance features vs. code quality - ship working products

    India-specific insights - CIBIL, Indian banks, local user needs

⚠️ Important Rules:

    Test everything after implementation before moving to next feature

    Line number references for all code changes

    No overwhelming copy-paste - clear, targeted changes

    Production mindset - build for real users, not just demos

🚀 IMMEDIATE GOALS:

Help me implement the next feature systematically while maintaining the professional code quality we've established. Continue the same mentoring approach that helped me grow from messy 2500-line files to clean, production-ready architecture.

Ready to continue building Kora Expense Tracker! 🎯

// Account operations
Future<int> insertAccount(Account account) async {

    if (account.balance > 0) {
      final categories = await getCategories();
